# Bebop Tools for Node
This package contains the `bebopc` Bebop compiler for Windows, MacOS and Linux, a small node wrapper, plus a Javascript API for integration with other tooling.

You can install it globally to add the `bebopc` command to your path. It should behave identically to the raw executable.
`npm install -g bebop-tools`
