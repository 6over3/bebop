# Bebop

Bebop is a schema-based binary serialization technology, similar to Protocol Buffers or MessagePack. In particular, Bebop tries to be a good fit for clientâ€“server or distributed web apps that need something faster, more concise, and more type-safe than JSON or MessagePack, while also avoiding some of the complexity of Protocol Buffers, FlatBuffers and the like.
