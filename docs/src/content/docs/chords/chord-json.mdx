## Introduction

`chord.json` is the manifest file for Chord extensions in the Bebop ecosystem. Similar to `package.json` in JavaScript projects, it contains crucial metadata about the extension, build instructions, and defines the contributions the extension makes to the Bebop compiler. This document serves as a comprehensive reference for developers creating or maintaining Bebop extensions.

## File Structure

The `chord.json` file is a JSON document with several key sections:

1. Metadata
2. Build Configuration
3. Contributions (Generator and Decorators)
4. Engine Compatibility
5. Additional Fields

Let's explore each section in detail.

## 1. Metadata

These fields provide basic information about your extension:

```json
{
  "name": "@namespace/extension-name",
  "private": false,
  "description": "A brief description of your extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "repository": "https://github.com/your-repo/extension-name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "url": "https://your-website.com"
  }
}
```

- `name`: (Required) String. Must be URL-safe, lowercase, and max 214 characters.
- `private`: (Optional) Boolean. If true, the extension won't be published to a registry.
- `description`: (Required) String. Max 280 characters.
- `version`: (Required) String. Must follow semver format.
- `repository`: (Optional) String. HTTPS URL of the extension's repository.
- `license`: (Required) String. The license identifier or a custom license string.
- `author`: (Optional) Object containing `name` (required), `email` (optional), and `url` (optional).

## 2. Build Configuration

This section specifies how to build your extension:

```json
{
  "bin": "./dist/extension.wasm",
  "build": {
    "script": "npm run build",
    "compiler": "tinygo",
    "args": ["--optimize"],
    "env": {
      "DEBUG": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

- `bin`: (Required) String. Path to the compiled WASM file.
- `build`: (Required) Object containing:
  - `script`: (Required) String. The command to build the extension.
  - `compiler`: (Required) String. Options: "as" (AssemblyScript), "tinygo", or "javy".
  - `args`: (Optional) Array of strings. Additional arguments for the build command.
  - `env`: (Optional) Object. Environment variables for the build process.

## 3. Contributions

This crucial section defines what your extension contributes to Bebop:

```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "generator": {
      "alias": "mycodegen",
      "name": "My Code Generator"
    },
    "decorators": {
      "validate": {
        "description": "Adds validation to a struct or field",
        "allowMultiple": false,
        "targets": "struct|field",
        "parameters": {
          "type": {
            "description": "Type of validation",
            "type": "string",
            "required": true
          },
          "message": {
            "description": "Custom error message",
            "type": "string",
            "required": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Generator

If your extension provides a code generator:

- `alias`: (Required) String. A unique, lowercase identifier for your generator.
- `name`: (Required) String. A human-readable name for your generator.

### Decorators

Each decorator you define becomes available in Bebop schemas. Here's a detailed breakdown of the decorator properties:

- Key: The name of the decorator (e.g., `validate`).
- `description`: (Required) String. Explains the decorator's purpose.
- `allowMultiple`: (Optional) Boolean. Whether the decorator can be used multiple times on the same target.
- `targets`: (Required) String. Specifies where the decorator can be used. This is a crucial property that determines the valid contexts for the decorator.
- `parameters`: (Optional) Object. Defines the parameters the decorator accepts:
  - Key: The parameter name.
  - `description`: (Required) String. Explains the parameter.
  - `type`: (Required) String. The parameter's type (e.g., "string", "int32", "bool").
  - `required`: (Optional) Boolean. Whether the parameter is mandatory.
  - `default`: (Optional) The default value if not provided.

#### Understanding Decorator Targets

The `targets` property is a powerful feature that allows you to control where your decorator can be applied in Bebop schemas. It uses a flag-based system to specify valid targets.

Valid target options:
- `"all"`: Can be used on all possible targets.
- `"enum"`: Can be used on enum definitions.
- `"message"`: Can be used on message definitions.
- `"struct"`: Can be used on struct definitions.
- `"union"`: Can be used on union definitions.
- `"field"`: Can be used on fields within structs, messages, or unions.
- `"service"`: Can be used on service definitions.
- `"method"`: Can be used on methods within services.

You can combine multiple targets using the `|` character. For example, `"struct|field"` means the decorator can be used on both struct definitions and fields.

The runtime behavior of target validation is sophisticated:

1. If `targets` is set to `"all"`, the decorator can be used anywhere, with a special exception for the `deprecated` decorator, which cannot be used on structs or fields.

2. For specific targets, the system distinguishes between "container" targets (enum, message, struct, union, service) and "member" targets (field, method).

3. A decorator can be valid for:
   - Only container types (e.g., `"struct|message"`)
   - Only member types (e.g., `"field|method"`)
   - Both container and member types (e.g., `"struct|field"`)

4. When both container and member types are specified, the decorator is only valid when used on a member within a valid container. For example, if `targets` is `"struct|field"`, the decorator can be used on fields within structs, but not on fields within messages or enums.

This flexible system allows you to create highly specific decorators that are only valid in certain contexts, enhancing the type safety and expressiveness of your Bebop schemas.

Example usage in a Bebop schema:

```bebop
@validate(type: "email", message: "Invalid email format")
struct User {
  email: string;
}
```

In this example, the `@validate` decorator is applied to a struct, which is valid because its `targets` include `"struct"`.

## 4. Engine Compatibility

Specifies compatible versions of the Bebop compiler:

```json
{
  "engine": {
    "bebopc": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

- `bebopc`: (Required) String. A semver range of compatible Bebop compiler versions.

## 5. Additional Fields

Other useful fields you might include:

```json
{
  "readme": "README.md"
}
```

- `readme`: (Optional) String. Path to your README file.
- `dependencies`: (Optional) Object. Any dependencies your extension requires.

## Impact on Bebop Compilation

Understanding how `chord.json` affects Bebop is crucial:

1. **Extension Loading**: Bebop uses this file to load and initialize your extension.
2. **Code Generation**: If you define a generator, Bebop integrates it as an option for code generation.
3. **Schema Enhancement**: Decorators you define become available in Bebop schemas, extending the language's capabilities.
4. **Build Process**: Bebop follows your build configuration to compile the extension.
5. **Version Checking**: Bebop ensures compatibility based on the `engine` field.

By carefully crafting your `chord.json`, you're not just configuring an extension - you're extending Bebop itself, giving developers new tools and capabilities in their schemas and code generation processes.

## Example

Here's a complete example of a `chord.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "@betwixt/typescript-template",
  "private": false,
  "description": "A template for chords built with TypeScript",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "repository": "https://github.com/betwixt-labs/bebop",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Betwixt Labs",
    "email": "code@betwixtlabs.com"
  },
  "bin": "dist/index.wasm",
  "build": {
    "script": "yarn build",
    "compiler": "javy"
  },
  "contributes": {
    "generator": {
      "alias": "validators",
      "name": "Record Validators"
    },
    "decorators": {
      "validate": {
        "description": "Validates a record",
        "allowMultiple": false,
        "targets": "struct"
      },
      "length": {
        "description": "Validates the length of a field",
        "allowMultiple": false,
        "targets": "struct|field",
        "parameters": {
          "min": {
            "description": "Specifies the minimum length of the field",
            "type": "int32",
            "required": true
          },
          "max": {
            "description": "Specifies the maximum length of the field",
            "type": "int32",
            "required": false,
            "default": 100
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "engine": {
    "bebopc": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "readme": "README.md"
}
```

This example demonstrates a fully configured `chord.json` file for a Bebop extension that provides a code generator and two decorators. It includes all the necessary metadata, build configuration, and contribution definitions.
