title: What are chords?
---

Extensions for the Bebop compiler are known as chords. They are written in any programming language that compiles to WebAssembly. 

A chord can define a new generator, decorators, and extend the behavior of other generators.

When installing `bebopc` it also installs [chordc](../chordc), the official compiler for `chord` binaries which takes source code / WebAssembly modules and prepares them for use with `bebopc`.

In addition, `chordc` enables [publishing](../publishing) and [installing](../installing) of chords to and from the [Chord Registry]() respectively. 

If you're interested in writing an extension for the Bebop compiler, we provide extension development kits (EDKs) for:

- [TypeScript/JavaScript]()
- [TinyGo]()
- [AssemblyScript]()

:::note
If you're interested in writing a chord in a language that isn't listed above, please [open an issue]() and we'll work with you to get it added.

:::caution
Compiler extensions are still experimental and the ABI is subject to change.
