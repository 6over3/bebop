# Understanding Chords: Bebop Compiler Extensions

Chords are powerful extensions for the Bebop compiler, designed to enhance and customize its functionality. These extensions play a crucial role in expanding Bebop's capabilities and tailoring it to specific needs.

## Key Features of Chords

- **Language Flexibility**: Chords can be written in any programming language that compiles to WebAssembly, offering developers freedom in their choice of implementation.
- **Extensibility**: A chord can define new generators, introduce custom decorators, and extend the behavior of existing generators.
- **Seamless Integration**: Chords integrate smoothly with the Bebop ecosystem, leveraging the `chordc` compiler for preparation and distribution.

## The Chord Ecosystem

### chordc: The Chord Compiler

When you install `bebopc`, it comes bundled with [chordc](../chordc), the official compiler for chord binaries. `chordc` serves several critical functions:

1. **Compilation**: It takes source code or WebAssembly modules and prepares them for use with `bebopc`.
2. **Publishing**: Enables [publishing](../publishing) of chords to the [Chord Registry]().
3. **Installation**: Facilitates [installing](../installing) chords from the Chord Registry.

### Extension Development Kits (EDKs)

To streamline the process of writing Bebop extensions, we provide EDKs for popular languages:

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/betwixt-labs/bebop/tree/vnext/extensions/edks/typescript)
- [TinyGo](https://github.com/betwixt-labs/bebop/tree/vnext/extensions/edks/tinygo/)
- [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/betwixt-labs/bebop/tree/vnext/extensions/edks/assemblyscript)

These EDKs offer a foundation and tools to help you get started quickly with chord development.

## Capabilities of Chords

Chords can significantly enhance the Bebop compiler's functionality:

1. **Custom Generators**: Create new code generators tailored to specific languages or frameworks.
2. **Decorators**: Introduce custom decorators to add metadata or behavior to Bebop schemas.
3. **Generator Extensions**: Modify or extend the behavior of existing generators to suit particular needs.

## Use Cases

- Generating code for specialized frameworks or libraries
- Implementing custom validation logic
- Creating language-specific optimizations
- Extending Bebop's type system for specific domains

## Getting Started

To begin working with chords:

1. Choose your preferred language and corresponding EDK.
2. Set up your development environment using the EDK's guidelines.
3. Familiarize yourself with the chord API and Bebop's extension points.
4. Start developing your custom functionality.

For detailed guides on creating, publishing, and using chords, refer to our [documentation](guides/authoring-extensions).

:::caution
Compiler extensions are currently in an experimental phase. The ABI (Application Binary Interface) may undergo changes as we refine and stabilize the system.

By leveraging chords, you can tailor Bebop to your specific needs, extending its capabilities and integrating it seamlessly into your development workflow.
