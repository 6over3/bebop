To install an extension, you need to have `chordc` on your system. This is installed when you install Bebop.

Once you have `chordc` installed, you can use the following methods to install extensions:

1. Install a specific extension:
```sh
chordc install <extension-name>
```

2. Install a specific version of an extension:
```sh
chordc install <extension-name>@<version>
```

3. Install all extensions listed in bebop.json:
If you're in a directory containing a `bebop.json` file with listed extensions, simply run:
```sh
chordc install
```

This command will automatically install all extensions specified in the `bebop.json` file.
