To install an extension you need to have `chordc` on your system. You can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/betwixt-labs/bebop/releases)._createMdxContent

Then, you simply need to run the following command:

```sh
chordc install <extension-name>
```

Alternatively you can also install a specific version of an extension:
    
```sh
chordc install <extension-name>@<version>
```
