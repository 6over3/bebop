title: Publishing Extensions
---

Once you've developed and tested your Bebop extension, you're ready to share it with the world. This guide will walk you through the process of publishing your extension.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:
- Your extension is complete and tested.
- You have a `chord.json` file correctly configured in your extension's root directory.
- You have the `chordc` CLI tool installed.

## Step-by-Step Publishing Process

### 1. Create an Account

- Visit the [Betwixt Labs Console](https://console.betwixtlabs.com)
- Sign in with your GitHub account

### 2. Generate an API Key

- Navigate to the API Keys section in the console
- Create a new API key
- Keep this key secure, as you'll need it for publishing

### 3. Set Up Your Environment

Export the API Key as an environment variable in your shell:

```sh
export CHORD_AUTH=<your-api-key>
```

Replace `<your-api-key>` with the actual API key you generated.

### 4. Publish Your Extension

Navigate to the directory containing your extension and run:

```sh
chordc publish
```

This command will package your extension and upload it to the Bebop extension registry.

## After Publishing

### Viewing Extension Statistics

After publishing, you can view statistics for your extension:

1. Go to the [Betwixt Labs Console](https://console.betwixtlabs.com)
2. Navigate to your extension's page
3. Here, you'll find download statistics for each version of your extension

This information can be valuable for understanding your extension's adoption and usage patterns.

### Accessing the Autogenerated Page

Each published extension gets an autogenerated page at:

```
https://betwixtusercontent.com/chord/{name}/{version}
```

Replace `{name}` with your extension's name and `{version}` with the specific version number.

This page provides a quick reference for users interested in your extension, including its description, version information, and usage instructions.

## Best Practices

- **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for your extensions. Increment the version number in your `chord.json` file before publishing a new version.
- **Documentation**: Ensure your `README.md` file is up-to-date and provides clear usage instructions.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your extension before publishing to ensure quality and reliability.
- **Release Notes**: Consider adding release notes or a changelog to help users understand what's new or changed in each version.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during publishing:
- Ensure your API key is correct and properly set in your environment.
- Check that your `chord.json` file is valid and contains all required fields.
- Verify that you're in the correct directory containing your extension files.
