title: Getting started
---

:::note 
This documentation is a WIP. Please feel free to suggest improvements or share feedback. We want to make getting started painless.
:::
This tutorial assumes you've already set up a monorepo for your project, for example:
```
.
├── client
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── components
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── public
│   └── ...
├── server
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── services
│   │   ├── validators
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── ...
└── shared
    ├── src
    │   ├── types
    │   ├── utils
    │   └── index.ts
    └── ...
```

## TSConfig 

Tempo utilizes decorators. As such, you'll need to set `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` to `true` in your tsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  },
  "include": ["server", "client", "shared"]
}
```

## Code Generation

Tempo uses [Bebop](https://github.com/6over3/bebop) for generating client and service code. To install it, follow the commands below:
```
yarn add bebop
yarn add bebop-tools --dev
```

By default, `bebopc` produces client and server code in the same output. You'll need to add the following dependencies to your project:
```
yarn add @tempojs/client @tempojs/server
```

If your client and server code lives in the same project, you can install Tempo into it.

```json
{
    "include": [
        "**/*.bop"
      ],
    "generators": {
        "ts": {
            "outFile": "./shared/index.ts"
        }
    }
}
```
Now, you can create your first service. Create a 'greeter.bop' file in your shared project with the following contents:

```go
/** 
 * `HelloRequest` is a struct representing a request to the Greeter service.
 */
 struct HelloRequest {
    /** 
     * The name to be used in the greeting, of type string.
     */
    string name;
}

/** 
 * `HelloResponse` is a struct representing the response from the Greeter service.
 */
struct HelloResponse {
    /** 
     * The greeting message generated by the service, of type string.
     */
    string serviceMessage;
}

/** 
 * `Greeter` is a service that provides a method for generating greeting messages.
 */
service Greeter {
    /**
     * `sayHello` is a method that takes a `HelloRequest` and returns a `HelloResponse`.
     */
    sayHello(HelloRequest): HelloResponse;
}
```

Now, just run `yarn bebopc build` and it will generate all the shared code into `index.ts`. 

## Implementing a Service

The Bebop compiler produces concrete client implementations and abstract base service for you to implement. For example:
```typescript
// registers 'GreeterService' with the 'TempoServiceRegistry'
// we use 'BaseGreeterService.serviceName' as this is how
// the service is referenced by generated code
@TempoServiceRegistry.register(BaseGreeterService.serviceName)
export class GreeterService extends BaseGreeterService {
  public sayHello(
    record: IHelloRequest,
    context: ServerContext
  ): Promise<IHelloResponse> {
    return Promise.resolve({ serviceMessage: `Hello ${record.name}` });
  }
}
```

A service that you wish to expose to clients _must_ be registered using the `TempoServiceRegistry.register` decorator as shown above. The parameter passed to `TempoServiceRegistry.register` is always the `serviceName` present on the base class of the service. Failure to register a service that was defined in a schema will result in a runtime error when initializing the server. At this time it is recommended that you reexport all services under a single export:
```typescript
//index.ts
import { GreeterService } from './greeeter'

export { 
   GreeterService
}
```
