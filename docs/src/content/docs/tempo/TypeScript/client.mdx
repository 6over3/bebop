title: Using a Client
---

Assuming you already have `@tempojs/client` as a dependency in your project, then all you need to do is import models from your shared codebase to use them:
```typescript
import { GreeterClient } from '../shared';
// creates a new channel pointing at the Tempo server running locally
const channel = TempoChannel.forAddress('http://localhost:3000');
channel
  .getClient(GreeterClient)
  .sayHello({ name: 'World' })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.serviceMessage);
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    if (e instanceof TempoError) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  });
```
or more simply if your project supports top-level await
```typescript
const channel = TempoChannel.forAddress("http://localhost:3000");
const client = channel.getClient(GreeterClient);
const response = await client.sayHello({name: "World"});
console.log(response.serviceMessage);
```
