title: Using Tempo with Node HTTP

import { Tabs, TabItem, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Quick

Tempo supports any server that can use Node HTTP, so you don't have to use a serverless platform to use it. This example shows how to use Tempo with Node's HTTP server.

For a see the online example, see the [Node HTTP example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-tempo) on StackBlitz.


First, install the Tempo router for Node into your project:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @tempojs/node-http-router
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @tempojs/node-http-router
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, inside your `index.ts` (or wherever your server handler resides) do the following steps:


1. Import your services 
```typescript
import * as Services from './services';
```
2. Add this line after your import call
```typescript
typeof Services;
```

:::note
This is a temporary workaround to decorators not being triggered unless there is a reference made to them
:::

Now you're ready to create the router:
```typescript
// creates a logger that will be used by Tempo
// can be anything that implements `TempoLogger`, `ConsoleLogger` is just built in.
const logger = new ConsoleLogger('worker', TempoLogLevel.Debug);
// initialize the service registry. this class is generated for you.
const registry = new TempoServiceRegistry(logger);
// create a new router
// `any` refers to our environment objects type; it is recommended to set it an explicit type (MyEnvObj, etc.)
const router = new TempoRouter<any>(
	logger,
	registry
);

const server = createServer(
  // feed incoming messages into the router
  async (req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse) => {
    await router.process(req, res, {}));
  }
);
server.listen(3000);
```
