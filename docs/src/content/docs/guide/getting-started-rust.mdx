There are two packages to be aware of, the Rust runtime [`bebop`](https://crates.io/crates/bebop) and the compiler-helper [`bebop-tools`](https://crates.io/crates/bebop-tools).

So to get started, add the `bebop` package to your `dependencies` and add `bebop-tools` to your `build-dependencies` if you plan to use a cargo build script for generating the Rust code. Next, add the necessary steps to your build script to build the schema, this is an example buildscript:

```rust
// build.rs
use bebop_tools as bebop;

fn main() {
    // download the bebop binary automatically and cache it into your target directory
    // it will automatically download the same version as the package you installed
    bebop::download_bebopc(
        PathBuf::from("target").join("bebopc"),
    );
    // build all `.bop` schemas in `schemas` dir and make a new module `generated` in `src` with all of them.
    bebop::build_schema_dir("schemas", "src/generated");
}
```

Right now `bebop-tools` is pretty bare-bones as far as what it supports, but at least with auto-downloading it should help with automation&mdash;if not do it for you.

Now assuming you have the schema
```c
// schemas/mystruct.bop
struct MyStruct {
  int32 a;
  int32 b;
}
```

To actually build the generated file run `cargo build` and you should see `src/generated/mystruct.rs` is created automatically. You may want to add the generated directory to your git ignore. Also be aware that any changes to files in generated will be wiped out on _every single_ build. Or if you have an IDE that is constantly running in the background like I do, after any change you save...

Also `src/generated/mod.rs` is generated automatically for you and will publicly declare all the schemas as modules.

In your code, you can now write something like this:
```rust
// main.rs
pub mod generated;

use bebop::prelude::*;
use generated::mystruct::MyStruct;

fn main() {
    let mut buf = Vec::with_capacity(MyStruct::SERIALIZED_SIZE);
    let s1 = MyStruct {
        a: 123,
        b: -6232
    };
    s1.serialize(&mut buf).unwrap();
    let s2 = MyStruct::deserialize(&buf).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(s1, s2);
}
```

Pro-tip: Check out the `owned` module which is generated behind a feature flag. If you enable `bebop-owned-all` or the appropriate namespace flag (only if you generated with a namespace) you can then access versions of all Records which do not borrow the data but simply take ownership/clone the data. These can be useful if you want to use bebop types throughout your codebase and not just for serialization.

That should be enough to get you kick-started. Checkout the crate docs for the runtime [here](https://docs.rs/bebop/latest/bebop/) and pay extra close attention to the [`Record`](https://docs.rs/bebop/latest/bebop/trait.Record.html) trait which is the main bebop sterilization definition.
