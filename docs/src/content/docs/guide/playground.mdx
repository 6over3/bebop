Writing your first _bop_ isn't a daunting task. In fact, it's quite easy.

Below are a number of ways you can experiment with Bebop, preview code generation, and get an understanding of how it might integrate into your projects.


## Playgrounds 

Playgrounds allow you to run `bebopc` **in your browser, without installing anything!**

They are mostly useful for:
- Testing Bebop
- Reporting bugs

Choose one of the available options below.

## REPL

The REPL is a great way to experiment with Bebop. It's an online version of `bebopc` that allows you to write Bebop IDL and see the generated code right away without installing anything.
