Bebop is modern data serialization format. It provides a simple schema language that can be used to generate fast, efficent, type-safe code for a variety of languages.

Unlike competing formats, Bebop is designed to be used in a variety of contexts, from embedded systems to web applications without compromising speed, safety, interoperability, and most importantly - developer experience.
