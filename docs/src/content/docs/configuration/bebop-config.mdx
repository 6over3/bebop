title: What is a bebop.json
---

The presence of a `bebop.json` file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a Bebop project. The bebop.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile schemas in the project.

Schemas in a project are compiled in one of the following ways:
- By invoking `bebopc` with no input files, in which case the compiler searches for the `bebop.json` file starting in the current directory and continuing up the parent directory chain.
- By invoking `bebopc` with no input files and a `--config` (or just `-c`) command line option that specifies the path of a `bebopc.json` file containing the configuration.

When input files are specified on the command line, includes in the `bebop.json` file are ignored. This is true for any configuration that can be specified in the `bebop.json` file and on the command line.

## Examples

- Using the `include` property
```json
{                
  "include": [  
      "**/*.bop" 
  ]
}
```

- Using the `exclude` property
```json
{                
  "include": [  
      "**/*.bop" 
  ],   
  "exclude": [  
      "node_modules/**/*.bop", 
  ]             
}
```

- Generating TypeScript code
```json
{                
  "include": [  
      "**/*.bop" 
  ],   
  "exclude": [  
      "node_modules/**/*.bop", 
  ],             
  "generators": {
    "ts": {
      "outFile": "dist/bops.gen.ts"
    }
  }
}
```
