title: Service
---

In Bebop a `service` defines an aggregate of methods that can be called by a client. 

There are for different types of service methods:

- `unary` - a single request and response
```bebop
service Greeter {
    sayHello(MyRequest): MyResponse ;
}
```
- `server streaming` - a single request and a stream of responses from the server
```bebop ins="stream"
service Greeter {
    sayHello(MyRequest): stream MyResponse;
}
```
- `client streaming` - a stream of requests and a single response from the server
```bebop ins="stream"
service Greeter {
    sayHello(stream MyRequest): MyResponse;
}
```
:::note
Client streaming is not supported in browser environments.
:::
- `duplex streaming` - a stream of requests and a stream of responses from the server
```bebop ins="stream"
service Greeter {
    sayHello(stream MyRequest): stream MyResponse;
}
``` 

## Code Generation

[Tempo](https://github.com/betwixt-labs/tempo) is the offical RPC library for Bebop. 

When the compiler emits code related to services, it will do so to match the implementation of Tempo in the target language.

For more information see the [Tempo documentation]().

To control the types of service code that are generated (client vs. server) you can use 

```json
```
