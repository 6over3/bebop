Bebop has builtin support for the following data types:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `bool` | A Boolean value, true or false. |
| `byte` | An unsigned 8-bit integer. `uint8` is an alias. |
| `uint16` | An unsigned 16-bit integer. |
| `int16` | A signed 16-bit integer. |
| `uint32` | An unsigned 32-bit integer. |
| `int32` | A signed 32-bit integer. |
| `uint64` | An unsigned 64-bit integer. |
| `int64` | A signed 64-bit integer. |
| `float32` | A 32-bit IEEE [single-precision floating point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format). |
| `float64` | A 64-bit IEEE [double-precision floating point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format).  |
| `string` | A length-prefixed UTF-8-encoded string. |
| `guid` | A [GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). |
| `date` | A [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) date / timestamp. |
| `T[]` | A length-prefixed array of `T` values. `array[T]` is an alias. |
| `map[T1, T2]` | A map, as a length-prefixed array of (`T1`, `T2`) association pairs. |

You may also use user-defined types (`enum`s and other records) as field types.

A string is stored as a length-prefixed array of bytes. All length-prefixes are 32-bit unsigned integers, which means the maximum number of bytes in a string, or entries in an array or map, is about 4 billion (2^32).

A `guid` is stored as 16 bytes, in [Guid.ToByteArray](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid.tobytearray?view=net-5.0) order.

A `date` is stored as a 64-bit integer amount of “ticks” since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1 of year 1 A.D. in the Gregorian calendar, where a “tick” is 100 nanoseconds.
