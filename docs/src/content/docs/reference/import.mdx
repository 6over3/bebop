title: Import
---

A Bebop schema may include all the definitions of other schemas, by listing `import` statements at the top of the schema.

Such a statement consists of `import`, followed by a quoted relative path:
    
```go
import "../other.bop"

struct MyStruct {
    OtherType other;
}
```

The imported schema is then available for use in the current schema.
