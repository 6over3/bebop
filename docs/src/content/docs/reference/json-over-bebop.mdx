title: JSON-Over-Bebop
---

The JSON-Over-Bebop format is designed as a compatibility layer that enables Bebop's type validation on JSON data and (de)serializes JSON into generated Bebop [records](../records).

This compatibility is achieved by annotating JSON with type information within the JSON, specifically for types that are not natively supported by JSON and for types that require explicit clarification.

:::note
JSON-Over-Bebop is currently only supported by the TypeScript runtime.

## Annotated JSON

The following illustrates a typical JSON-Over-Bebop data format:

```json
{
  "a_int64": {
    "#btype": 4,
    "value": "6"
  },
  "a_date": {
    "#btype": 2,
    "value": "629592660000000000"
  },
  "a_map": {
    "#btype": 1,
    "#ktype": 7,
    "value": {
      "false": true,
      "true": false
    }
  }
}
```

- `#btype` (Bebop Type): This marker is used to associate the data with a specific Bebop type that helps in the marshaling process.
- `#ktype` (Key Type): This marker is utilized in maps to revive the actual type of the map keys.

## Native JSON

It's important to note that `#btype` and `#ktype` are not mandatory if the data object is natively supported by JSON. In this case, a regular JSON is valid JSON-Over-Bebop:
```json
{
    "title":"The Song",
    "year":1996,
    "performers":[{"name":"The Performer","plays":0}]
}
```

Runtime checks will still be performed to validate data types, ensuring alignment with the schema. If any members that are required or known do not have the correct runtime type, a `BebopRuntimeError` is raised, indicating that the JSON was invalid.

## Type Tags

The JSON-Over-Bebop format supports the following type tags:

- `bigIntTag` (4): For BigInt (long/ulong) values.
- `boolTag` (7): For Boolean values.
- `stringTag` (8): For String values.
- `numberTag` (9): For Number values.
- `dateTag` (2): For Date values.
- `uint8ArrayTag` (3): For Uint8Array/byte[] values.
- `guidTag` (5): For Guid values.
- `mapTag` (1): For Map values.
- `mapGuidTag` (6): For GuidMap values.

```json
{
  "a_bigInt": {
    "#btype": 4,
    "value": "123456789123456789"
  },
  "a_map": {
    "#btype": 1,
    "#ktype": 8,
    "value": {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation

The functionality of this format is implemented through a custom replacer and reviver function for `encodeToJson` and `fromJson` respectively. These functions will handle the marshaling of Bebop records.

Additionally, a `BebopRuntimeError` is raised if the provided JSON does not comply with the defined schema for a given record, ensuring a robust and reliable JSON (de)serialization process.

The reviver function also supports the conversion of values back into their respective runtime types, with the help of type markers (`#btype` and `#ktype`).
