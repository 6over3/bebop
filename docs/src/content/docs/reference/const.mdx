title: Const
---

A `const` definition defines a single typed value. You can't refer to these values in the rest of a Bebop schema, but they come in handy when the parties using your schemas also need to agree on certain application-wide parameters.

Currently, valid const types are: `boolean`, `integers`, `floats` (including `inf`, `-inf`, `nan`), strings, and `GUIDs`.

For example:

```typescript
const int32 PianoKeys = 88;
const guid ImportantProductID = "a3628ec7-28d4-4546-ad4a-f6ebf5375c96";
```

## Environment Variables & String Substitutions

A `const` definition can also be used to define a string that is substituted at compile time. This is useful for defining environment variables that are used in your application, but that you don't want to hard-code into your schema.

For example:

```typescript
const string ApiUrl = ${API_URL};
```

When you compile this schema, the compiler will look for the `API_URL` environment variable and substitute it into the schema. If the environment variable is not set, the compiler will throw an error.

You can also use string substitution to build strings which contain environment variables. For example:

```typescript
const string ApiUrl = "${BASE_API_URL}/v1";
```

## .dev.vars
When developing locally, add environment variables by creating a .dev.vars file in the root directory of your project alongside `bebop.json`. Then you can populate like so:
```env
API_URL=https://api.example.com
```
